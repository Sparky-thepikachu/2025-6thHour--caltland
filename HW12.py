#1. Create a while loop with variable i that counts down from 5 to 0 and then prints
#"Hello World!" at the end.
'''
i =  5
while i > 0:
    print(i)
    i -= 1
else:
    print("Hello World!")
#2. Create a while loop that prints only even numbers between 1 and 30 (HINT: modulo).
j = 1
while j<=30:
    j+=1
    if j%2==0:
        print(j)

#3. Create a while loop that prints from 1 to 30 and continues (skips the number) if the
#number is divisible by 3.
k = 1
while k<=30:
    k += 0
    if k % 3 == 0:
        print(k)
#4. Create a while loop that randomly generates a number between 1 and 6, prints the result,
#and then breaks the loop if it's a 1.
import random
L = 3
L = random.randint(1,6)
while True:
    print(L)
    if L == 1:
        break
    else:
        l = random.randint(1,6)
            '''
#5. Create a while loop that asks for a number input until the user inputs the number 0.
p = int(input("Enter a number between 1 and 6: "))
while p <=6:
    print(p)
